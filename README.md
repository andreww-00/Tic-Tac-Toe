## General Info and Motivation

This project was created to explore the module pattern for creating and utilizing objects, as well as to enhance my DOM manipulation skills in JavaScript.

## How to Use

- Access the game [here](https://andreww-00.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/)!
- Click the "Start" button to initiate a game and load the game board.
- Take turns with your friends, marking X or O on the game board.
- Once a player achieves a three-in-a-row match, the game will display the winner.
- Click the "Restart" button to reset the game.

## What I Learned

- How to effectively employ the module pattern to create small, locally scoped modules for later use in the code.
- How to make locally scoped modules accessible to the rest of the code.
- How to maintain a clean global scope by encapsulating most of the code.

## Improvements

- Implement a way to play against AI, either by selecting a random square or utilizing a min-max function.
- Create an option to choose between X and O for each player.
- Improve the mobile-friendliness of the site.
